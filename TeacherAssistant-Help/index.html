        <h2>Application Overview</h2>
        <p>This app is a learning management tool designed to simplify teachersâ€™ daily tasks while improving studentsâ€™ 
            learning experience. The app offers powerful features for managing student data, designing and delivering 
            customized learning activities, tracking progress, and generating formal assessments. Built with flexibility 
            and a user-friendly interface, the app can track the learning process in parallel through lesson activities 
            and assessments, as well as behavioral events related to the learning process, specifically designed for use 
            in teaching.<br><b>In essence, the app acts as a complete digital companion for teachers, reducing the distractions 
                of a teacherâ€™s work and enabling a more focused and effective teaching process.</b>
</b><br><br>
<b>Some of features:</b>
<ul class="fancy-list">
<li>Teacher can easily register and edit his/her students ID card details or import bulk data via CSV files, ensuring 
    quick onboarding and seamless integration with existing school records. The system allows for individualized or group 
    assignment of learning activities, offering a personalized approach to student engagement.
</li>
<li>To continuous learning improvement, the application provides detailed tracking of student activities, enabling educators
     to monitor learning outcomes on a per-student basis.
</li>
<li>Learning progress is supported through record and track behavioral events for each student, giving a better vision of growth over time. 
    Academic performance and behavioral patterns are tracked through an integrated dashboard that lets you monitor both quantitative metrics 
    (test scores) and qualitative observations (learning behavioral change notes) in integrated student profiles and discover teaching and learning 
    patterns over time through analytical tools.
</li>

<li>Application provides a built-in editor that allows the teacher to design custom learning activities.
     This editor supports importing content in a variety of formats including text, images, PDF, HTML, and LaTeX.
</li>

<li>Allows the teacher to produce and export assessments in in two formats: in-class quizzes and official school test formats, 
    aligning with diverse evaluation needs.
</li>

    formatting tools (LaTeX/HTML). All content is automatically organized into a searchable database that grows with your teaching career.
</li>

<li>By combining lesson planning tools, student analytics, and communication systems into one integrated platform, delivers an 
    enjoyable and scalable work experience. It is designed to make it easy for both advanced teachers (mastery of instructional 
    design tools like LaTeX) and novice teachers to easily produce and organize their own learning contents.
</li>

<li>Finally, to ensure data integrity and long-term usability, the application includes a dedicated tool for maintaining, 
    backing up, and restoring its database on Windows systems, safeguarding valuable information against loss or corruption.
